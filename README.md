# KWOC-report

### ABOUT KWoC
Kharagpur Winter of Code is an annual 5-week long online program organised by Kharagpur Open Source Society at IIT Kharagpur. It aims to help students who are new to open source software development. It also prepares them for many open source summer programmes like Google Summer of Code.

### My Experience
I have been learning web development for a long time now. I wanted to gain some experience and put my knowledge into action. KWOC, being beginner friendly helped me achieve this. Scrolling through the projects, I came accross **False9**. The project was very appealing, so I decided to contribute to it. I joined it's slack channel and got familiar with the mentor. He helped me to understand the working of project. He cleared all my doubts and made my KWoC journey successful. 

### PROJECT: False9
#### Github repository: https://github.com/Namanbhatia7/False9.git
#### Mentor: Naman Bhatia
It is a Node.js project which provides information about latest football Score updates, competitions and player stats, league standings and much more. It uses https://www.football-data.org/ API to fetch the required information.

### Contributing to False9
I worked on the 'Top Scorers Display' issue. My mentor guided me to redesign the top scorers display table. I added some styling to the top scorers table in my **first pull request**.

In my **second pull request**, I updated the top scorers table by adding some more styling to it.

### Verdict
I want to thank Naman Bhatia for his guidance in this project. I want to thank KOSS, IIT KGP for conducting this program for beginners. This program helped me to get familiar to open source projects and taught me how to contribute to them.
